# Kitchen Helper:

    Kitchen Helper is a best friend in the kitchen.
    This app combines the ability to track the items in your pantry,
    the opportunity to plan your meals for a given time period and puts a
    large database of recipes at your fingertips. This app also allows
    you to create and add your own recipes.

## Motivation:

    The motivation for this app was the idea that it would
    help those that wish to be more organized and pro-active
    in the kitchen.  It takes the guess work out of wondering
    what you have in your kitchen to create meals.  So, if
    you are someone who forgets easily, a busy parent that
    feels frazzled about what to cook, or an older couple
    looking to try something new, this app has something for everyone.
